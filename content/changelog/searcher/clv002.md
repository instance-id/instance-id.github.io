  Still working on finding the right mix of low poly and, well, not so low poly to make them blend together, as you can see from some of the newer pics (the first ones).  
  I am currently working on an RPG. I have not come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it is still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want to comment on or recommend, please do.
