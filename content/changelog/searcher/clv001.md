  I do know for sure I am going to implement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5 PVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup.  
  I wanted to keep things fairly low poly so that I could use some resources on nice looking particle and spell effects and other aspects of gameplay instead of realistic visuals.
