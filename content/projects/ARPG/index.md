  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently working on an RPG. I have
  not come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it
  is still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want
  to comment on or recommend, please do. I do know for sure I am going to
  implement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5
  PVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup. I wanted to keep
  things fairly low poly so that I could use some resources on nice looking
  particle and spell effects and other aspects of gameplay instead of realistic
  visuals. Still working on finding the right mix of low poly and, well, not so
  low poly to make them blend together, as you can see from some of the newer
  pics (the first ones).


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been throwing the idea back and
  forth to make the game bloody with dismemberment while keeping the visuals
  similar to how they are, but also have considered darkening everything up and
  going for a more gritty feel along with it. I kind of want to go for a mix of
  a game called Chivalry combined with RPG elements, not so much the typical WoW
  style RPG where you are usually just target locked and do rotational DPS. It
  is going to be swinging swords, with the ability to block, etc. Going to have
  mounts, bosses, streaming large open world. Lots of goodies.


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am mostly just making this because I
  have wanted to make games for around 15-16 years and finally decided to go for
  it. I will probably end up releasing it, but who knows, I may not. I am just
  enjoying the challenge and all the learning as aside from a few small crap
  games I made doing online tutorials, this is my first actual game and I want
  to make sure I can one day call it complete. 


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a gallery link of some shots if
  the pics end up getting cut off. I am not sure if any of the gif's will play
  either, so might have to go to the gallery anyways if you want to see some of
  the spell and weapon stuff.


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, thanks for taking a look! I have
  a twitter, but I only really just started using it, so I don't have much on
  there. I have remade my site since I took my old one down, so eventually, lol.
