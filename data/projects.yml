          Repentence is a small project in which the original intent goal was to learn Timeline, Cinemachine, Houdini, and proper settings for post-processing and the HD Render Pipeline.


          It has slowly shifted in the direction of becoming a short film, or possibly even a trailer to nothing. 


          It does have potential to continue on to a playable game in the vein of Resident Evil, Silent Hill, or even Devil May Cry.
