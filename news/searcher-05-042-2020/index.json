{"content":"\u003cp\u003e      JSONI am currently working on an RPG. I have\nnot come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it\nis still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want\nto comment on or recommend, please do. I do know for sure I am going to\nimplement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5\nPVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup. I wanted to keep\nthings fairly low poly so that I could use some resources on nice looking\nparticle and spell effects and other aspects of gameplay instead of realistic\nvisuals. Still working on finding the right mix of low poly and, well, not so\nlow poly to make them blend together, as you can see from some of the newer\npics (the first ones).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e      I have been throwing the idea back and\nforth to make the game bloody with dismemberment while keeping the visuals\nsimilar to how they are, but also have considered darkening everything up and\ngoing for a more gritty feel along with it. I kind of want to go for a mix of\na game called Chivalry combined with RPG elements, not so much the typical WoW\nstyle RPG where you are usually just target locked and do rotational DPS. It\nis going to be swinging swords, with the ability to block, etc. Going to have\nmounts, bosses, streaming large open world. Lots of goodies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e       I am mostly just making this because I\nhave wanted to make games for around 15-16 years and finally decided to go for\nit. I will probably end up releasing it, but who knows, I may not. I am just\nenjoying the challenge and all the learning as aside from a few small crap\ngames I made doing online tutorials, this is my first actual game and I want\nto make sure I can one day call it complete.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e       Here is a gallery link of some shots if\nthe pics end up getting cut off. I am not sure if any of the gif\u0026rsquo;s will play\neither, so might have to go to the gallery anyways if you want to see some of\nthe spell and weapon stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e      Anyways, thanks for taking a look! I have\na twitter, but I only really just started using it, so I don\u0026rsquo;t have much on\nthere. I have remade my site since I took my old one down, so eventually, lol.\u003c/p\u003e\n","dateposted":"05-04-2020","description":"description2 blurb for info","id":2,"title":"Header2 data info title","uri":"/news/searcher-05-042-2020/index.json"}
