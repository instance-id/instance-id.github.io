{"api":null,"content":"\u003cp\u003e      awdawd am currently working on an RPG. I have\nnot come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it\nis still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want\nto comment on or recommend, please do. I do know for sure I am going to\nimplement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5\nPVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup. I wanted to keep\nthings fairly low poly so that I could use some resources on nice looking\nparticle and spell effects and other aspects of gameplay instead of realistic\nvisuals. Still working on finding the right mix of low poly and, well, not so\nlow poly to make them blend together, as you can see from some of the newer\npics (the first ones).\u003c/p\u003e\n","date":"2020-05-04T09:05:27-05:00","dateposted":"05-04-2020","id":"v0_0_1","image_small":"images/projects/arpg/arpg_small.png","project":"searcher","tags":["v0.0.1","changelog"],"title":"V0.0.1 Change log","uri":"/api/v1.0/changelog/searcher/v0_0_1/json.json"}
