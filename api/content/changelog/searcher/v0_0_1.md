  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awdawd am currently working on an RPG. I have
  not come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it
  is still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want
  to comment on or recommend, please do. I do know for sure I am going to
  implement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5
  PVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup. I wanted to keep
  things fairly low poly so that I could use some resources on nice looking
  particle and spell effects and other aspects of gameplay instead of realistic
  visuals. Still working on finding the right mix of low poly and, well, not so
  low poly to make them blend together, as you can see from some of the newer
  pics (the first ones).
