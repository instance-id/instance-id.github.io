      <description>awdawdawd1111 am currently working on an RPG. I have not come up with a name for my game yet, let alone a story line. A lot of it is still subject to change as well. So if you see anything you feel you want to comment on or recommend, please do. I do know for sure I am going to implement co-op, maybe like 3-4 people to quest together and also 3v3 or 5v5 PVP, possibly a team deathmatch or objective style setup.</description>
